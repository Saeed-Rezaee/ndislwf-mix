(though it implements your logic in *user space*, it still work fine for <1Gbps throughput)

Filter driver do not provide direct support for legacy send and receive operations that are based on the NDIS_PACKET structure.

Instead, NDIS converts receive indications from legacy miniport drivers to NET_BUFFER structures.

Also, NDIS handles the  required conversions from send requests that are based on NET_BUFFER structures to legacy send requests that are based on NDIS_PACKET stuctures.



Filtr drivers call the NdisFSendNetBufferLists function to send the network data that is defined in a list of NET_BUFFER_LIST structures.
